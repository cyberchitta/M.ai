# M.ai

An AI that can answer questions as the Master (Sri Aurobindo) or the Mother (Mirra Alfassa) might have answered them.

The first version [**M.ai**](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-iAYDHm7Gq-m-ai) is an Open AI GPT.

The next version M.ai (under development) is an Elixir LiveView application. This app has now been moved to it's own repo at [llm_chat_phx](https://github.com/restlessronin/llm_chat_phx).


Portions of this project were developed with assistance from Claude 3 Opus. However, every line of code is human curated (by me, @restlessronin ðŸ˜‡).

All of the works of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother are available for RAG.
