# M.ai

An AI that can answer questions as the Master (Sri Aurobindo) or the Mother (Mirra Alfassa) might have answered them.

The first version [**M.ai**](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-iAYDHm7Gq-m-ai) is an Open AI GPT. This current version (under development) is an Elixir LiveView application.

Portions of this project were developed with assistance from Claude 3 Opus. However, every line of code is human curated (by me, @restlessronin ðŸ˜‡).

All of the works of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother are available for RAG.
